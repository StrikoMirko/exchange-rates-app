# Exchange rate test app

This is a POC React router, React-Redux app connecting to Exchange rate API (https://exchangeratesapi.io/).

Its sort of nice-ish :D.


### Requirements
`node 6x`
`yarn`

## Setup

```yarn```

## Development

To start development start the development server
```yarn start```

This will create a local webserver at http://localhost:5678 where the app can be accessed and tested.

## Testing

When TDD use command
```yarn test-debug```. This spins up karma in watch mode.

To run tests only once, like for CI/CD run ```yarn test```
## Linting issue
``` yarn lint```

## Fix linting issue
```yarn lint-fix``` to automatically fix problems

## Production
Build the code, compress it and store it in ```dist``` with command ```yarn build```
